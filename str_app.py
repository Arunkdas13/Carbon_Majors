This app is inspired by the article *["Will it ever be possible to sue anyone for damaging the climate?"](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41558-024-01941-w)* by Christopher W. Callahan and Justin S. Mankin, published in *Nature Climate Change*.  
We gratefully acknowledge the authors for introducing an **end-to-end attribution framework** that links fossil fuel producersâ€™ emissions to specific climate damages, using a combination of **Scope 1 and 3 emissions data**, **FaIR climate model simulations**, and **empirical climate economics**. Their methodology underpins the scientific justification for climate liability claims.

This app also draws from replication materials publicly provided through the [IEEE DataPort repository](https://ieee-dataport.org/open-access/replication-carbon-majors-and-scientific-case-climate-liability), titled **"Replication for Carbon majors and the scientific case for climate liability"**. These materials include Python and Jupyter scripts for:

- Running FaIR climate model simulations of carbon major emissions  
- Scaling regional climate impacts from global averages using CMIP6  
- Calculating regional and event-specific economic damages  
- Producing visualizations found in the original paper  

We thank the authors for their open-access contributions and acknowledge funding support from the **National Science Foundation (NSF)**, the **Neukom Institute**, and the **Wright Center at Dartmouth College and Rockefeller Center** under **NSF Grant #1840344**.

This app is designed to help users visualize the scientific links between corporate emissions and global warming, with the goal of supporting education, transparency, and future efforts in climate accountability.
